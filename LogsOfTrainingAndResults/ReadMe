# Federated Learning Experiment Logs

This repository contains training and testing logs for multiple federated learning experiments conducted using different numbers of nodes and data distributions. Each folder represents a distinct experimental setup based on the number and type of participating nodes.

## Folder Structure

Each top-level folder follows the naming format:

<NODES><DISTRIBUTION>seed/


Where:
- `<NODES>`: Number of federated nodes (e.g., 2, 4, 8, 16).
- `<DISTRIBUTION>`:
  - `h` = Heterogeneous data distribution (Non-IID).
  - `r` = Random data distribution.
  - The 2-node setup (`2seed/`) has only one default distribution type.

### Example Folders:
- `2seed/`: 2 nodes with a default data distribution.
- `4hseed/`: 4 nodes, heterogeneous data.
- `8rseed/`: 8 nodes, random data.
- `16hseed/`: 16 nodes, heterogeneous data.

## Contents of Each Folder

Each folder contains:
- **5 Training Logs**: One for each run using seeds 0 to 4.
  - Files are named like:  
    - `training<NODES><TYPE>seed<SEED>.log`
    - Example: `training4hseed0.log`  
- **15 Testing Logs**: 3 per repetition (total of 5 repetitions Ã— 3 tests):
  - For each repetition, there are testing results on:
    - `TACO` dataset
    - `PlastoOPol` dataset
    - Combined/Full testing set (`all`)
  - Files are named in the format:
    - `testing<model-ID><TYPE>.log`
    - Example: `testing1321TACO.log`, `testing1321Plast.log`, `testing1321all.log`

- **run_tests.sh**: A script used to run the evaluation for the best-performing model for each repetition.
